# EquationAcc
EquationAcc is a Word VSTO (Visual Studio Tools for Office) Addin written in Visual Basic. 
It contains some functions that I find useful for creating and editing Microsoft equations. 
I first wrote it in VBA in late 2019 and added some functionality over time. 
In June 2022 I started to convert it to VB in Visual Studio with a proper ribbon interface. 
I also added further functionality.
So there is now a proper install file (without full certification) and it installs the add in with a proper ribbon interface.
